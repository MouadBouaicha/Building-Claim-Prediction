# Building Insurance Challenge Pipeline

## 1. Problem Definition:
- Key Question: Predict the probability of a building having at least one insurance claim during the insured period.
- Objective: Maximize the normalized Gini coefficient to prioritize higher probability predictions.

## 2. Data:
- Dataset: Check the provided data containing variables like Identifiant, ft_2_categ, EXPO, superficief, Insee, target, and other ft_i_categ.
- External Data: Consider using external data like shops number, unemployment rate, and weather by INSEE code for additional insights.

## 3. Evaluation:
- Metric: Use the normalized Gini coefficient for model evaluation.
- Benchmark: A basic xgboost model achieved a 0.41 NGC score.

## 4. Features:
- Identify key features: superficief, ft_22_categ, EXPO.
- Explore potential feature engineering opportunities.

## 5. Preparing the Tools:
- Required Libraries: Use common libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost, and any additional libraries for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

## 6. Data Exploration (EDA):
- Compare different columns: Analyze relationships between variables and the target variable.
- Handle missing values: Determine strategies for dealing with missing data.
- Outliers: Identify and assess outliers.
- Data Balance: Check if the dataset is balanced, considering stratification.
- Frequency Analysis: Use pd.crosstab() for frequency analysis.
- Scatterplots: Visualize relationships between variables.
- Distribution: Plot distributions of key variables.
